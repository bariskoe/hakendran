# baristodolistapp

This is yet another Todo List app which was fully written by me, Baris Kosebas. I have created it because I really want
to use it in real life and to apply the newest version of the Bloc state management.
In order to apply the Intl package and to set the base for a possible publication in the Appstore or Playstore, I 
integrated localization for English, German and Turkish.
